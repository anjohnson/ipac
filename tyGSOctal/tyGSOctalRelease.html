<H2>GreenSpring Octal Serial Driver Release Notes</H2>
<P>Software by <I>Peregrine McGehee</I><BR>
Release by <I>Andrew Johnson</I></P>
</CENTER>

<P>This document describes changes made to Peregrine McGehee's vxWorks driver
for the GreenSpring Octal RS232/RS422/RS485 IndustryPack modules  since this
driver was merged into the unbundled EPICS ipac support area.  Version numbers
refer to the release of the ipac support software as a whole.  The earliest
version appears at the bottom, with more recent releases above it. </P><HR>

<H2>Version 2.3</H2>

<P>Modified documentation to indicate non-support of the new IP-OctalPlus
module family, which uses different UARTS.</P>

<P>Added Burkhard W. Kolb's RebootHook routine to turn off interrupts.</P>

<H2>Version 2.1</H2>

<P>Updated due to changes made to drvIpac, and also actually tried it out for
myself - got some interrupts but I haven't done a full test.</P>

<P>Changes:<UL>

<LI>Use <TT>ipmIntConnect</TT> to attach the ISR. </LI>

</UL></P>

<P>Bugs fixed:<UL>

<LI>Now works with the ipmv162 carrier driver - the interrupt vector register
was being accessed at an offset from the I/O space, which works on GreenSpring
carriers but doesn't meet the IPAC specification.  The register is correctly
accessed in the IP memory space, which means that this must be mapped in. </LI>

</UL></P><HR>


<H2>Version 2.0</H2>

<P>First version containing this driver, ipac support is now structured as an
EPICS R3.13.1 &lt;supporttop&gt; application. </P>

<P>Added:<UL>

<LI>This driver software and these release notes.</LI>

</UL></P>

<P>Bugs fixed:<UL>

<LI>Gcc compilation warnings attended to.</LI>

</UL></P>
