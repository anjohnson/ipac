IPAC Support Application Structure
==================================

Sites may wish to edit the Makefile found in this directory to change
the list of module drivers to be built along with the ipac driver.
Additional driver directories will have to be added to the Makefile by
hand.  This is intentional to allow the distribution to include all of
the standard IP module drivers in the future without requiring every
site to build them all.

- Andrew Johnson, March 1999
